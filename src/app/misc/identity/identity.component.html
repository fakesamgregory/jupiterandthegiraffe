    <h1>Brand Identity</h1>

    <p>
      Your brand identity (or logo) is usually the first thing people see. It's the most iconic part of your brand so shouldn't be understated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your identity can take many forms. An Icon, typeface or even both! Without an identity that has meaning your brands message is totally lost.
      It's a shortcut to your values, messaging and, of course, your identity.
