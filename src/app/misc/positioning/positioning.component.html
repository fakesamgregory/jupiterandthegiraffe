    <h1>Brand Positioning</h1>

    <p>
      During our <a [routerLink]="'/service/brand-strategy'">Brand Strategy</a> session we help establish what position
      in the market you exist in. As the old saying goes, if you try and speak to everyone, you're speaking to no one.
      We get you to narrow your thinking so that your brand can have signifcantly more impact by making sure you're
      speaking directly to a certain type of person.
    </p>

    <p>
      Brand Positioning also makes you think about what makes you different and how you will stand out, not just in what you
      offer but how you will offer it.
