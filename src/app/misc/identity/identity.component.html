    <h1>Brand Identity</h1>

    <p>
      Not to be confused with our <a [routerLink]="'/service/brand-identity'">"Identity"</a> service,
      your brand identity (or logo) is usually the first thing people see.
      It's the most iconic part of your brand so shouldn't be understated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your identity can take many forms. An Icon, typeface or even both! Without an identity that has meaning your brands message is totally lost.
      It's a shortcut to your values, messaging and, of course, your identity. It's important that you understand the users you
      are trying to attract with your logo and the problems its trying to solve so we help you do that in
      <a [routerLink]="'/service/brand-strategy'">Strategy</a>.
    </p>

      If you're interested in a new logo or brand identity, let us know.
