        <h3>What are cookies</h3>

        <p>
          Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser.
          They are widely used to “remember” you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a “session cookie”) or for multiple repeat visits (using a “persistent cookie”).
          They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in.
          Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as “first party cookies”), or by third parties,
          such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (“third party cookies”).
        </p>

        <p>
          Session cookies are only stored for the duration of your visit to the website and will be removed when the browser window is closed. For example, when you close your browser window the relevant authentication cookie is removed and you will need to login again the next time you visit the website.
        </p>

        <p>
          Permanent cookies are stored for a period of time and are used to identify you when you return to the site. For example, your username may be remembered on the login page.

          some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users;
          and some allow the display of advertising from selected third party networks.
