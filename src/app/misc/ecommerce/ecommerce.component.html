    <h1>Ecommerce</h1>

    <p>
      Short for 'Electronic Commerce', Ecommerce refers to the selling of goods online.
      It can also be attributed to any kind of transaction online.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Ecommerce Models</h2>

    <p>
      There are four main types of ecommerce models that can describe almost every transaction that takes place between consumers and businesses.
    </p>

    <ol class="list-plain">
      <li>
        <strong>Business to Consumer (B2C):</strong>
        When a business sells a good or service to an individual consumer
        (e.g. You buy a pair of shoes from an online retailer).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Business to Business (B2B):</strong>
        When a business sells a good or service to another business
        (e.g. A business sells software-as-a-service for other businesses to use)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Consumer to Consumer (C2C):</strong>
        When a consumer sells a good or service to another consumer
        (e.g. You sell your old furniture on eBay to another consumer).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Consumer to Business (C2B):</strong>
        When a consumer sells their own products or services to a business or organization
        (e.g. An influencer offers exposure to their online audience in exchange for a fee, or a photographer licenses their photo for a business to use).
      </li>
    </ol>
